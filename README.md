# Alexa-Rage-Quit
Just my code for making alexa rage quit

This code uses an Arduino Leonardo and Wemos d1 board. The transmittor is the wemos board the receiver is the Arduino Leonardo. 

It acts like a macro to quit out of the game. It can be used for other games just needs a bit of tinkering. It also uses the AbsMouse library. 

The transmittor or wemos board uses WIRE() and also has to be used with Sinric. The 'transmittor' code is pretty much just a rip off of their example, so check them out! This works with just normal sinric no need to use sinric pro.

Feel free to use and update all you want just please keep the code spaghetti.
